Yii Framework Skeleton App
======================
This is a generic Yii Framework application with MySQL integration. I built this simple app as the starting point for many projects I have worked on in the past. This application allows for user registration, user sign-in and sign-out, Facebook/Google+/Windows Live sign-in, and password reset.

This skeleton application does not include the Yii Framework itself. Download it [here](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii/).

## Extensions
I've included some extensions that I pretty much always use. These include:
* Twitter (Yii) Bootstrap ([Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/Crisu83/yii-bootstrap))
* Font Awesome ([GitHub](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome))
* Notify Bar ([GitHub](https://github.com/dknight/jQuery-Notify-bar))
* Randomness ([GitHub](https://github.com/tom--/Randomness))
* PHPMailer (YiiMailer) ([GitHub](https://github.com/vernes/YiiMailer))
* Facebook PHP SDK ([GitHub](https://github.com/splashlab/yii-facebook-opengraph))
* [Google PHP Client Library](https://code.google.com/p/google-api-php-client/)
* [Windows Live JS SDK](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/live/hh243643.aspx)
* LESS CSS - PHP Compiler

## Notice
This is a general starting point for beginning development of your project. You should have some understanding of the Yii Framework and your own server environment in order to get this skeleton app configured and working on your local environment. By default, this application is configured to my WAMP server.
